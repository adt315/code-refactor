## Horiseon Webpage Code Refactor

The objective of this project was to refactor the Horiseon webpage to make it accessible while also improving the code for long-term sustainability.

This was accomplished by:
- creating a descriptive title for the webpage
- making sure all links function properly 
- adding alt attributes for image elements
- ensuring the HTML elements follow a logical structure
- organizing the CSS file to follow the structure of the HTML elements 
- consolidating CSS selectors and properties 
- including comments in the HTML and CSS files
 
Using version control allowed me to make changes to the code and then go back to a previous version(s) to compare if needed.

Future additions to this website might include:
- providing contact information for Horiseon
- adding client reviews
- creating a heading for the Benefits section
- creating links to more details about Horiseon's services
